This is the Debian package for setools, and it is built from sources
obtained from: http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/code/download5.cfm.

This package was debianized by Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au> on
Wed, 19 Nov 2003 20:44:14 +1100.

This package is maintained by Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>.

The orig.tar.gz has been repacked to omit the debian directory, and
the minial changes required to reflect that deletion in the autotools
files.  There were many incompaible changes in Debian directory in the
upstream package, and this was the minimally disruptive way to package
setools for Debian.
