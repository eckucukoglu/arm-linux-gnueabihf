GLib2.0 for Debian
-------------------

Static libraries issue:
Right now glib2.0 provides some static libraries. If your application
uses g_module* functions or other libraries uses g_module* functions and
your application link it, Please don't statically link this libraries.
You may get some strange proglem between static-linked application and
dynamic-loaded modules, g_module* provides the feature for dynamically
loading some modules.
This is well-known bug, so please don't file a bug report.
