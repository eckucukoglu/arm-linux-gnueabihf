.SH "DESCRIPTION"
semanage is used to configure certain elements of
SELinux policy without requiring modification to or recompilation
from policy sources.  This includes the mapping from Linux usernames
to SELinux user identities (which controls the initial security context
assigned to Linux users when they login and bounds their authorized role set)
as well as security context mappings for various kinds of objects, such
as network ports, interfaces, and nodes (hosts) as well as the file
context mapping. See the EXAMPLES section below for some examples
of common usage.  Note that the semanage login command deals with the
mapping from Linux usernames (logins) to SELinux user identities,
while the semanage user command deals with the mapping from SELinux
user identities to authorized role sets.  In most cases, only the
former mapping needs to be adjusted by the administrator; the latter
is principally defined by the base policy and usually does not require
modification.
